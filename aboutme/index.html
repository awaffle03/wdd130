    <p1>Hi everyone! This class is an exciting new adventure for me, but I am also nervous. I have no expirience with coding or computers in general,
        but I'm ready to learn!I am the oldest of 5 kids in my family, and I have a twin sister that is my best friend. I am currently taking online
        classes and living in my home state so I can work at a job I love and spend time with my family and friends. I love the beauty of the outdoors, 
        the magic of reading, and the power of a really good nap.</p1>

 <bodyp2>I am a sophmore at byui, and I spent the first three semesters on campus, and 
    found it was not for me. I am majoring in Business Managment and liking some accounting 
    classes, which is a little surprising. I work at a chick-fil-a in my area and love it. 
    I hope to one day help open my own cfa resturaunt with my coworkers, who have become 
    some of my best friends.</bodyp2>
